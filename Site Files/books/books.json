                "The Radiant series follows the lives of Jax, his sister, Ev, and the monster hunter, Birdie, as they journey across and beyond the world of Doxla to defend themselves and their homes against those who would seek to destroy or enslave them. As they travel, they will slowly uncover the secrets behind their world's existence, as well as the true nature of the beings known as Divine, including the all-powerful Masters.",
                "The first book centers around Jax and his journey to protect the titular Heart of the Radiant from the immortal hordes of the Undead King, Dezeroth. Failure means the return of the Dark Radiant, which would upend the current world order. Success may mean something far worse.",
                "The second book follows Birdie as she struggles against the Radiant, Lux Rosa, while reality itself slowly begins to fall apart. When forced to confront her own origins and purpose, Birdie learns the secrets of the Divine and also that the slaughter that would result from Lux Rosa's victory may in fact be the safer option for Doxla's future.",
                "The third and final book follows Ev as she discovers the true reason for Doxla's creation by the Masters, but she also sees firsthand the devastation left behind by their actions. In the wake of such revelations, she will find herself torn toward both sides of the final battle that will decide the fate of not only everyone she cares about, but countless other worlds touched by the Masters' machinations as well."

Why would the world’s creators suddenly abandon it to destruction and decay? Perhaps if his world wasn’t burning down around him, Jax Ruthoree would have time to ponder these thoughts, but not now. Now, he must survive. He must do everything in his power to prevent the return of the Dark Radiant.

Most importantly of all, he must prevent the Heart of the Dark Radiant from falling into the clutches of the Undead King, Dezeroth, or at least that is what Jax believes. Perhaps if he pondered a bit more, he might question his resolve. If he knew the true nature of his world, he might even welcome its end. Instead, he marches bravely and blindly on, his journey but the first step to revealing the truth behind everything."

If that happens, Lux Rosa’s power will become absolute, and all that Birdie cares for will come to an end. Unfortunately for Birdie, the answers that wait at the end of her journey may just be enough to make her question if Lux Rosa has the right ideas after all."
