        <p class="description-text">
          Back in his undergraduate days while studying electrical engineering,
          Daniel attempted to write his first book. This attempt has been lost
          to the archives and will never see the light of day. His dream of
          writing never went away, however, and after marrying his wonderful
          wife, he tried twice again in graduate school.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of those attempts will also forever be locked away, but the other
          was his first attempt at the Armonia series. For a number of reasons
          (including being busy publishing his dissertation), the Armonia series
          was temporarily shelved. The experience was an educational one,
          however, and in February 2020, Daniel published his first full-length
          novel, which blended his love of fantasy and video games into a single
          world.
          <br />
          <br />
          In August 2022, Daniel published the final book of the Radiant
          trilogy, and he hopes that others will find both these books and
          future titles engaging and enjoyable.
