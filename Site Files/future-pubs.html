          The Witch of World's End: The Book of Prophecy
        </h1>
        <p class="description-text">
          The first book of The Witch of World's End series follows a prideful
          young witch named Lyn after she learns of the titular Book of
          Prophecies and the royal order of heroes training to rid the kingdom
          of witchcraft. Though little is known of the contents of the book, it
          is clear that it's by the book's direction that the crown has
          redoubled its efforts to snuff out dark magic.
          <br />
          <br />
          Accompanied by her adoptive sister Zahra and a mysterious thief named
          Faux, Lyn must find a way to infiltrate the order of heroes and claim
          the bothersome book for herself. It could just prove to be the edge
          witches need to finally fight back against the royal family. Then
          again, the secrets within might just be enough to make Lyn question
          her own hopes and ambitions.

        <h1 class="book-title">The Armonia Series</h1>
        <p class="description-text">
          The Armonia series will primarily follow Lapis Kaghani in her journey
          across the world in a quest to bring about a cure for the Blight. For
          millennia, this supernatural plague has slowly but unyieldingly spread
          across the land, corrupting mind, body, and even matter itself.
          <br />
          <br />
          To succeed in her journey, Lapis will need to overcome longstanding
          animosity between the eight races of the world. Little will she
          realize that her journey serves another purpose, as a plan decades in
          the making unfolds around her.
