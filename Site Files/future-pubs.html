                    The Mind of the Radiant
                </h1>
                <p class="description-text">
                    Five years after the events of The Heart of the Radiant, follow Birdie on her journey to the city
                    of the Divine, Ars Summis. A new Radiant known as Lux Rosa has appeared, and through her
                    machinations she has begun to tap into the power of the Masters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is now a race against time as Birdie seeks to contact the only true Divine who could
                    help them against this menace. Failure means Lux Rosa obtains absolute control over the world.
                    Success... means the battle for Doxla is only beginning.

                <p class="description-text">
                    In this third installment of the Radiant series, follow Ev as the world itself is torn asunder when
                    the fabled Masters return to bury their darkest secrets. Enemies will become allies
                    or perish as forces from beyond the world of Doxla seek to put an end to all that threatens the
                    Masters' multiversal reign.

                    Journey beyond the boundaries of Doxla in this climactic finish to the series in a battle
                    that will truly decide the fate of the world... and potentially the fate of many others.

                    The Armonia Series
                </h1>
                <p class="description-text">
                    The Armonia series will primarily follow Lapis Kaghani in her journey across the world in a quest
                    to bring about a cure for the Blight. For millennia, this supernatural plague has slowly but unyieldingly spread
                    across the land, corrupting mind, body, and even matter itself. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To succeed in her journey, Lapis will need to overcome longstanding
                    animosity between the eight races of the world. Little will she realize that her journey serves 
                    another purpose, as a plan decades in the making unfolds around her.
