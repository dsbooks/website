                    The Armonia Series
                </h1>
                <p class="description-text">
                    The Armonia series will primarily follow Lapis Kaghani in her journey across the world in a quest
                    to bring about a cure for the Blight. For millennia, this supernatural plague has slowly but unyieldingly spread
                    across the land, corrupting mind, body, and even matter itself. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To succeed in her journey, Lapis will need to overcome longstanding
                    animosity between the eight races of the world. Little will she realize that her journey serves 
                    another purpose, as a plan decades in the making unfolds around her.
